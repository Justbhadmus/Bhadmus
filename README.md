## API Automation assessment

---


### Task

---

- [ ]  Get a random user (userID), print out its email address to console.

- [ ]    Using this userID, get this userâ€™s associated posts and verify they contains a valid Post IDs (an Integer between 1 and 100).

- [ ]   Do a post using same userID with a non-empty title and body, verify the correct response is returned (since this is a mock API, it might not return Response code 200, so check the documentation).

### Solution

---

- [ ] I used a page object model to create a solution.
- [ ] With the help of research, I was able to understand the Java language a bit better in that Data Types are very important to method declaration.
- [ ] The main tool used is rest-assured and it was imported as a maven dependency.
- [ ] The script can be executed using the testng.xml file.
